# The middle most value in a data series is called the median. The median() function is used in R to calculate this value.
# median(x, na.rm = FALSE)

# Following is the description of the parameters used âˆ’
    # x is the input vector.
    # na.rm is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.

# Create the vector.
x <- c(12,7,3,4.2,18,2,54,-21,8,-5)

# Find the median.
median.result <- median(x)
print(median.result)
