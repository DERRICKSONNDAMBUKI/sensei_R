# y = 1/(1+e^-(a+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+...))

# Following is the description of the parameters used âˆ’
    # y is the response variable.
    # x is the predictor variable.
    # a and b are the coefficients which are numeric constants.
# The function used to create the regression model is the glm() function.

# The in-built data set "mtcars" describes different models of a car with their various engine specifications. In "mtcars" data set, the transmission mode (automatic or manual) is described by the column am which is a binary value (0 or 1). We can create a logistic regression model between the columns "am" and 3 other columns - hp, wt and cyl.

# select some columns form mtcars.
input <- mtcars[,c("am","cyl","hp","wt")]
# print(head(input))

# create a regression model
am.data = glm(formula = am ~ cyl + hp + wt, data = input, family = binomial)
print(summary(am.data))

# In the summary as the p-value in the last column is more than 0.05 for the variables "cyl" and "hp", we consider them to be insignificant in contributing to the value of the variable "am". Only weight (wt) impacts the "am" value in this regression model.
