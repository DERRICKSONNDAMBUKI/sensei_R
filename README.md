### Install a New Package

There are two ways to add new R packages. One is installing directly from the CRAN directory and another is downloading the package to your local system and installing it manually.
#### Install directly from CRAN

The following command gets the packages directly from CRAN webpage and installs the package in the R environment. You may be prompted to choose a nearest mirror. Choose the one appropriate to your location.
```
 install.packages("Package Name")

# Install the package named "XML".
 install.packages("XML")
```
### Load Package to Library

Before a package can be used in the code, it must be loaded to the current R environment. You also need to load a package that is already installed previously but not available in the current environment.

A package is loaded using the following command âˆ’
```
library("package Name", lib.loc = "path to library")

# Load the package named "XML"
install.packages("E:/XML_3.98-1.3.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
